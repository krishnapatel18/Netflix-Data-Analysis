# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This repository showcases my learning as I learn Data analysis using Python's libraries in Jupyter Notebook.  

In this project - 
=> I have analyzed Netflix dataset with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
=> Derived insights into genre distribution, genre popularity, and movies with the highest and lowest popularity and their genre, year with the most released movies, to understand user preferences and content evolution. 

I have learned this project from YT.
